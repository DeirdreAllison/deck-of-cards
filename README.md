When building this, I attempted to follow BDD beginning with user stories which led me to start by creating a test to
verify that the deck has 52 cards. From here, I made a Cards and Deck class and then filled them in.

I decided to use arrays for the suit, number and deck to make for a short, readable program.

I created tests to verify that each deck will have 52 cards and also to verify the correct suits are present.
However, there are many more tests that could be added including verification that cards don't repeat,
verification of specific cards, etc.
